I am especially looking forward to delving further into the ever-increasing pile of statistical methods used to analyse microbial community data. This role will also see me taking on teaching responsibilities within the School of Life Sciences, where I will be educating students on a variety of programming and data-science related topics, in preparation for becoming a lecturer in a few years time (hopefully!).

bio-available form, to an inert gas. New evidence suggests that phosphorus may determine the
reaction pathways and fate of nitrogen in riverbed systems. My role as senior research officer on this project
was to undertake molecular analyses of the relevant N-cycling microbial communities to determine how
phosphorus, sediment structure, and microbial communities interact to process nitrogen."""

unifying theme of macroecology, using a variety of data sources and study systems. I showed that the relation-
ship between temperature and microbial diversity is not consistent, and more isolated sites show markedly
different patterns. I also collected the most high-resolution dataset to date on halophilic Archaea, which I
used to show that these extremophilic microbes do not conform to classic biogeographic regionalisation."""
