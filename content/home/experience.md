  description = """Porous riverbed sediments provide an important ecosystem service by cycling nitrogen from a soluble 
bio-available form, to an inert gas. New evidence suggests that phosphorus may determine the 
reaction pathways and fate of nitrogen in riverbed systems. My role as senior research officer on this project 
is to undertake molecular analyses of the relevant N-cycling microbial communities to determine how 
phosphorus, sediment structure, and microbial communities interact to process nitrogen."""

unifying theme of macroecology, using a variety of data sources and study systems. I show that the relation-
ship between temperature and microbial diversity is not consistent, and more isolated sites show markedly
different patterns. I also collected the most high-resolution dataset to date on halophilic Archaea, which I
used to show that these extremophilic microbes do not conform to classic biogeographic regionalisation."""
